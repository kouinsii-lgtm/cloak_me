The private reading room for Whatsapp group messages
## Product Overview
Cloak me redefines control in communication. People are not always avoiding conversations they just need space. Someone may be busy, overwhelmed, resting, or simply thinking. But messaging apps currently treat reading as the same as responding. Cloak Me separates those two actions.
## What the product does
Cloak me lets you read Whatsapp group messages privately and choose when to send read receipts.
## Why it matters
Read receipts are more than a UI feature; they are tied to social expectations and relationships. When a user feels seen before they are ready, they feel:
* Rushed into communication
* obligated to respond
* Emotionally exposed, which then leads to anxiety from fast-moving family group chats, work or project-related groups, friend groups with emotional expectations but Cloak Me changes the emotional dynamic of messaging. It allows for privacy without disappearing, presence without urgency and participation on your own time.
## Target users
* People who prefer processing messages before responding
* Usera who want read message quitely
* Users with social anxiety or communication fatigue
* Students aor workers who read chats during short breaks but cannot reply immediately
* Users managing multiple responsibilities
* Anyone who wants more control over communication boundaries.
## Key features
### 1.) Secret Reading Mode (private view mode)
You can read your WhatsApp group messages inside Cloak Me. When you read them here, nobody can see that you have read the messages.
### 2.) Choose When They Know You Read (manual read receipt trigger)
Normally, WhatsApp shows a blue tick when you read a message. But with Cloak Me, you decide when to send that blue tick.
### 3.) Safe WhatsApp Connection (secure whatsapp account link)
You connect your WhatsApp in a safe way. Cloak Me does not keep your password or personal stuff.
### 4.) Same Group Chats, Same Look (group chat syncing and organization)
Your group chats appear in Cloak Me just like they do in WhatsApp, so you don’t have to learn anything new.
### 5.) Calm, Quiet Reading (distraction free reading interface)
No one can see if you’re typing or online, you can read messages peacefully without pressure.
